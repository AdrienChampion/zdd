`zdd` is a Zero-suppressed binary Decision Diagram library in Rust. It is based on [Zero-suppressed
BDDs and their applications][zdd paper] by Shin-Ichi Minato.

For details see [the documentation][doc].

# Warning

I wrote this crate a very long time ago, when I was a Rust newbie. There seems to be little interest
in this library, so I only barely maintain it. If you are serious about using it, consider letting
me know to see if I or someone else can improve or rewrite it.
